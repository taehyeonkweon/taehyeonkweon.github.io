I am a MASc student in Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am also a member of the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/waterloo-mechanical-systems-control-lab/), where I am advised by Professor [Soo Jeon](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/soojeon). Before this, I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My current research focuses on **active perception for robotic grasping**, where I develop **Next-Best-View (NBV)** algorithms to enhance perception and grasp success in cluttered environments.

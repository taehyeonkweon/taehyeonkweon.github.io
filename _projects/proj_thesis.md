This project was developed as part of my **B.Eng. Final Year Thesis** at  
_The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2024)_.

The robot features an **active suspension system** that adjusts wheel height to maintain body stability when traversing uneven terrain.  
It was implemented using Arduino, stepper motors, and mecanum wheels, with custom 3D-printed mechanical structures.

**Supervisor:** Prof. Henry Kar Hang CHU  
**Team Members:** Tae Hyeon Kweon, Luo Yuxiang, Li Jiashuo
